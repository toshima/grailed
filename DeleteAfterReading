Hey! My name is Tom, and I am a software engineering student at Temple University in Philadelphia.

You don't have any of your contact information listed, so this was the only way I could think of to get to you. I am sure you are very busy
so I will be brief.

I was going to make something similar, but all of my ideas were centered around using selenium webdriver as grailed doesn't have a public
API. When I came across your software I noticed that you're accessing their API - the better solution.

My question is: How did you find the API? 
I scanned all the network requests that the site makes using chrome developer tools, but couldn't find any calls to the url you use to
send requests to their API.

I love this sort of thing, and really want to know more, but I don't know where to start to learn. Would you suggest a resource that could
be a good place to start?

Thank you, and good hacking!
